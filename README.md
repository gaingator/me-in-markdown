## Introduction

Hello this is my official introduction! My name is Gian and I am in 10th grade. I have multiple hobbies such as playing soccer and playing video games. I go to Chatsworth High and am enjoying my time.

Currently I play a lot of video games and watch movies. A video game that I enjoy a lot currently is Cyberpunk 2077, some reasons being it's environment/open world gameplay being second to none, and it's wonderful storyline that compliments the world of Night City. Video games arent the only media I enjoy. I also enjoy watching videos off Youtube, with one of  my favorite channels being [Jfootballtv](https://www.youtube.com/@jfootballtv). His first person recordings filmed off a GoPro of playing football (soccer) always impress me when I watch. 

Through school and after school experiences, I have many aspirations for my career and future as a whole. I've taken some classes over the summmer, and now I aim at acheiving a career in the Biotechnology or pharmaceutical field in the future. I have always kept this field of work as a big contender, but after the summer classes and some of my teachers work, I now aim to support that dream fully.

I have a lot of expectations to look forward to in APCSA. Things like new coding language learning, coding my own websites and games, and learning a lot of new things in the world of programming. I also expect to have a good time learning, have many fin activities and experiences. Overall I look to having a great year under Mr. Aiello.
